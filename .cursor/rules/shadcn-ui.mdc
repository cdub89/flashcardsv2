# shadcn UI Component Guidelines

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements.

## Initialization

If shadcn UI is not initialized in the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

When you need a particular component that is not yet installed, use the following command format:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

### Examples

- To install the button component:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest add button
  ```

- To install the card component:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest add card
  ```

- To install the dialog component:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest add dialog
  ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Always use shadcn UI components for UI elements
- Check if a component is already installed before adding it
- Components are typically installed in the `components/ui` directory
- Follow shadcn UI's component API and patterns
